It?s been garage kept and lightly used, with just 17,000 miles. The stance is clean and purposeful, finished off with forged chrome wheels that catch the light without shouting. Press the start button and the LS3 6.2L V8 comes to life with a deep, confident tone. With 436 hp and a 6-speed automatic, it pulls hard and stays smooth. The Z51 package adds the extra edge, and the dual-mode performance exhaust gives you two moods in one car, calm when you want it, bold when you don?t. Inside, the black leather cabin feels more grand tourer than bare-bones sports car. The 3LT trim brings the comfort you?ll notice on every drive, heated seats, power seats on both sides, driver memory, and dual-zone climate control. The heads-up display keeps your eyes forward, and the Bose audio, XM, Bluetooth, CD, and factory navigation keep the ride easy to live with. Add keyless entry, cruise control, power windows and locks, universal home remote, fog lights, and OnStar, and it?s ready for both date nights and backroad runs. If you want a garage kept Corvette that looks sharp, sounds right, and feels special every time you drive it, this one fits.

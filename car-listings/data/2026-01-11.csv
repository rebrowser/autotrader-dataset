This would make an excellent commuter car, first car, or efficient second vehicle. Excellent efficiency: Drives about 35 miles full electric before switching to the gas engine, which gets ~40 MPG. Perfect for short commutes and city driving. Plug-in hybrid convenience: Charge at home up to 12 Amps. Smooth, comfortable ride with a quiet interior. Drives strong  engine, transmission, and battery all operate normally. Battery system is still healthy and efficient. OEM Chevy charging cable included  ready to plug in and use. Dealer-performed maintenance with records available, showing the car has been properly cared for. Well-maintained and dependable  not a neglected vehicle. Condition (Priced Accordingly &amp; Transparently): Exterior: Some clear-coat fading in a couple areas (cosmetic only). Mechanical: Small oil leak from the oil pan (minor, disclosed, and reflected in price). Interior: Clean, functional, and well cared for. Tires &amp; brakes: In good condition. This Volt is a solid, economical car that still has plenty of life left and extremely low operating costs compared to traditional gas vehicles. Price: $7,000 OBO Serious buyers only, please.

Please continue for more information regarding this 2016 GMC Canyon 4WD SLT with 77,154mi. When GMC created this vehicle with 4 wheel drive, they immediately enhanced the performance ability. Easily switch between two and four wheel drive to take advantage of the improved traction. One of the best things about this GMC Canyon is that it has low, low mileage. It's ready for you to truly break it in. Beautiful color combination with Onyx Black exterior over Jet Black interior making this the one to own! More information about the 2016 GMC Canyon: The GMC Canyon fits the bill for people who need a decent amount of utility but who don't want to deal with driving a full-sized pickup truck everywhere they go. As trucks have gotten more capable, they've also gotten bigger. Modern, full sized trucks are simply too big to be practical in many situations these days. Enter the GMC Canyon, with a footprint not much bigger than the average family sedan; it's maneuverable but still rugged enough for all of the jobs that can only be dealt with by a true pickup truck. The GMC Canyon competes with other compact trucks such as the Toyota Tacoma and the Nissan Frontier. Strengths of this model include Powerful engines, relatively compact footprint, available 4-wheel drive, quiet ride, towing capacity, and good fuel economy","[PREMIUM]",25,"5601 Ave O","Fort Madison","IA","52627","[PREMIUM]"

Equipped with an array of advanced features, the Outlander SE exceeds expectations and promises an enhanced driving experience.<br><br>One of the standout features of the Outlander SE is its Adaptive cruise control with traffic stop-go. This sophisticated technology enables drivers to set their desired speed while automatically maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front. The system not only brings the vehicle to a complete stop when traffic halts but also seamlessly resumes speed when the road clears, significantly reducing driver fatigue on long journeys.<br><br>Safety is a top priority in the Outlander SE, highlighted by its innovative Forward collision mitigation system. This intelligent feature continuously monitors the road ahead, preparing the vehicle and its occupants for potential collisions. By actively working to reduce the chances of accidents, the Outlander SE offers peace of mind on every drive.<br><br>Additionally, the Hands-on steering assist/lane centering feature acts as a personal co-pilot, ensuring that the vehicle remains centered within its lane with minimal driver effort. This technology is particularly beneficial during long drives, allowing for a more relaxing experience as long as your hands are on the steering wheel.<br><br>The Rear camera provides an invaluable safety enhancement, offering a clear view of obstacles and hazards behind the vehicle, making parking and reversing both safer and more convenient. Complementing this is the Lane departure prevention system, which assists in keeping the vehicle within its lane, further elevating overall driving security.<br><br>Moreover, the Rear collision mitigation system utilizes sensors to detect potential hazards behind you. If an impending collision is detected, it prepares the vehicle to mitigate impact, enhancing passenger safety.<br><br>Finally, the Brake assist feature is critical in emergency situations, maximizing stopping power when needed most. It senses panic braking and applies full brake force, ensuring quick reactions when every second counts.<br><br>In summary, the 2022 Mitsubishi Outlander SE 2.5 2WD is more than just a vehicle; it is a comprehensive driving solution that harmonizes cutting-edge technology, safety, and comfort.

This vehicle, equipped with a robust 2L I-4 gasoline direct injection engine, delivers an impressive 158HP through a continuously variable transmission CVT, blending performance with fuel efficiency seamlessly. Among its standout features is **Smart device mirroring**, which allows you to connect your smartphone to the vehicles infotainment system. This advanced technology ensures you can access your favorite apps without taking your eyes off the road, enhancing both safety and convenience.

Furthermore, the **Forward collision mitigation** system constantly monitors the road ahead, activating protective measures to help prevent or lessen the impact of potential accidents. In urban environments, the **Front pedestrian impact prevention** system is invaluable. It actively tracks pedestrians in your path, taking steps to avoid collisions and reinforcing Honda s commitment to road safety for all users.

The vehicle constantly monitors the roadway in front of the vehicle and identifies and tracks pedestrians on an interior display. If the system determines a likely impact, it will automatically take preventative steps to avoid hitting the pedestrian. The vehicle is equipped with a camera that displays an image of the area behind the vehicle on an interior display. Brake assist senses panic braking from the speed of the brake pedal's travel and applies all available power brake boost.Technology and Telematics Without the need for a manufacturer specific app to be installed on the smart device, the vehicle infotainment system can access and control functions of a smart device physically plugged-into the vehicle. Mobile devices can wirelessly connect to the internet through the vehicle's private mobile network.

I was gonna replace the plugs and coils but can't reach the back side of engine so you'd get that stuff too. The later pictures show it without the bra and the last one shows a couple scratches, the worst it has. Has a few light ones here and there but it's a 8-9 outa 10 if you'd ask me. The seats have neoprene covers on them that are a year or so old, too difficult to take off so I didn't want to take a picture with them off but they've had covers on them since we bought it used in 2015. I also installed a front and rear facing camera that'll record. The tires are around 4 year old but probably still have half there life left. We bought a new 4Runner, our retirement car, so that's the only reason for selling her. She's ALWAYS been a great car for us and it's a Toyota so she'll give you plenty of more miles.

Torque Monster This thing has 413 lb-ft of torque available pretty much as soon as you wantat just about 1,500 rpm. That means when you stomp the gas, you feel a shove back in your seat. Diesel Efficiency King For a luxury SUV that weighs nearly 5,000 lbs, it still does ~24 mpg city / 31 mpg highway / ~27 mpg combined . Thats way better than its gas-powered siblings. Range That Keeps Going Large fuel tank (about 22.4 gallons ) + good highway mpg = you can drive for 650+ miles without needing to refuel if you keep it chill. Minimal stops, more road trip vibes. Luxury + Utility Combo You get that high-end BMW feelnice finishes, solid engineering, luxury touches and the utility of an SUV. Plenty of room for people or cargo, solid towing capacity, all-wheel drive, etc. Strong Performer 255 horsepower doesnt sound insane up top, but with that torque low in the revs, passing, merging, climbing hills all feel strong. Ride Quality : The X5 xDrive35d offers a firm yet comfortable ride, with adaptive suspension options enhancing handling dynamics. Interior Comfort : High-quality materials and sound insulation contribute to a quiet and luxurious cabin environment.<br><br>","[PREMIUM]",29,"25341 CRENSHAW BLVD","Torrance","CA","90505","[PREMIUM]"

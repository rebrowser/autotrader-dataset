The exterior is finished in Obsidian Blue Pearl, a rich and deep blue shade with a subtle pearlescent shimmer that catches the light beautifully. This refined color enhances the Odysseys smooth body lines and elegant profile, giving it a stylish and sophisticated appearance whether your headed to school drop-off, a grocery run, or a weekend trip out of town.<br><br>From the front, the Odyssey EXL presents a confident and welcoming look. Its sculpted grille and sleek headlights work together to create a modern, cohesive face that feels both polished and purposeful. The proportions are planted and balanced, with smooth contours flowing from the front fascia down the sides and toward the rear. The Obsidian Blue Pearl finish adds depth and dimension to the minivans body, helping it appear sleek and upscale rather than utilitarian.<br><br>Stepping inside the 2020 Honda Odyssey EXL reveals a spacious and thoughtfully designed cabin built to make every journey comfortable and convenient no matter how many passengers your carrying or how much cargo you need to bring along. The EXL trim level elevates the interior with leather trimmed seats that feel soft yet durable, providing next level comfort for daily driving and long road trips alike. The drivers seat often includes power adjustments and heating, helping ensure a comfortable driving position from the moment you start your day. Heated front seats add an extra touch of comfort during colder months.<br><br>One of the Odysseys greatest strengths is its ability to seat up to eight passengers with ease. The second row seats typically come as sliding captains chairs, offering generous legroom and easy access to the third row essential for families or anyone who regularly carries passengers. The third row remains roomy and comfortable, suitable for adults on shorter drives or children on longer trips, making the Odyssey a practical choice for families of all sizes.<br><br>The dashboard and center console are thoughtfully organized with intuitive controls and high-quality materials that give the interior a refined feel. A centrally mounted touchscreen infotainment system puts entertainment, navigation (if equipped), and vehicle settings within easy reach. With Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, connecting your smartphone is both simple and convenient, letting you stream music, use navigation apps, and handle calls handsfree. Bluetooth connectivity and multiple USB ports help keep your devices connected and charged throughout every journey, and steering wheel mounted controls allow you to manage key functions while keeping your eyes on the road.<br><br>Climate comfort is a priority in the Odyssey. The EXL trim typically includes trizone automatic climate control, allowing the driver, front passenger, and rear passengers to choose their preferred temperature settings independently. This thoughtful feature helps keep everyone comfortable no matter how warm or cool the weather outside may be.<br><br>Cargo versatility is another major strength of this minivan. Behind the third row, there's generous cargo space for groceries, strollers, sports gear, suitcases, and everyday items. When you need even more room, the third row seats fold easily into the floor, and the second row seats can slide or fold to make space for larger or bulkier loads. Whether your hauling luggage for a family vacation or gear for weekend fun, the Odyssey adapts to your needs with ease.<br><br>","[PREMIUM]",32,"8442 US HIGHWAY 19","Port Richey","FL","34668","[PREMIUM]"

Stock number V26659. To check availability or schedule a test drive, call  . Shoppers looking for a new Volkswagen in the Naperville and Chicagoland area will appreciate this models features, performance, and value. Every new Volkswagen purchased at Bill Jacobs Volkswagen includes Bill Jacobs Total Protection, our complimentary 7 Year/100,000 mile Limited Powertrain Warranty that gives you long-term confidence and added peace of mind. Important Package and Feature Information Convenience Unresponsive driver assistant - a reaction to inaction. Maybe you fell asleep. Maybe you lost consciousness. No matter how it happens, Unresponsive driver assistant works to help lessen the danger when it does. It detects prolonged driver unresponsiveness, automatically bringing the vehicle to a stop and turning on the hazard lights. If equipped, emergency services will also be contacted. Unresponsive driver assistant is safety that never sleeps.Safety and Security Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control. Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead. Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.Technology and Telematics Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car. You can control your device through your vehicle's infotainment system. Smart device mirroring brings together safety and convenience by making it easier to find what you're looking for while keeping your eyes on the road. At Bill Jacobs Volkswagen, we are here to serve you with a straightforward and transparent car buying experience.

Here at Toyota Sunnyvale our goal is to provide our clients with the shopping experience they desire. We surveyed hundreds of our past clients to find out how they want to purchase a vehicle and we have listened. We designed a fast, fair, and simple process to save you time and eliminate the need for the back-and-forth that out clients have told us they dislike (or even hate!). You will find that we do things very different than you may have experienced in the past and have come to expect with other dealers. We call this: Simple Price, Simple Process! Our Simple Price will be the same regardless of where you see our vehicle. We do extensive research to know the market. We utilize the same reliable tools you may use (Kelley Blue Book, Edmunds, Craigslist, etc), as well as some others (sales data, auction data, shopping our competition), to offer every vehicle at a very fair and aggressive market-based purchase price. We use this process for every vehicle, new and used, to eliminate the need for back-and-forth negotiations. Our clients have told us that this develops trust and the confidence to purchase. This saves our clients time (in some cases even hours or days of negotiation) and provides the 100% transparent experience our clients tell us they want.<br><br>From your first contact with us (call, text, email or store visit), to the time you drive away in your new vehicle, our Simple Price and Simple Process will save you time. You will work with only one person from beginning to end. Your professional Sales Manager will present the vehicle you have selected and offer to share any others that are similar. Once you have selected the vehicle you would like to own, there is no need to negotiate. In addition, Toyota Sunnyvale s Simple Process has been streamlined by eliminating the wait for the Finance Department, saving you an hour (or two) to see &gt;","[PREMIUM]",31,"898 W EL CAMINO REAL","Sunnyvale","CA","94087","[PREMIUM]"

Insurance companies issue salvage titles when repair costs exceed 60-75% of a vehicle's value - often due to minor damage on newer cars, hail, theft recovery, or airbag deployment.

Insurance companies issue salvage titles when repair costs exceed 60-75% of a vehicle's value - often due to minor damage on newer cars, hail, theft recovery, or airbag deployment. This has been professionally rebuilt to OEM standards and passes all safety inspections. The great news? You're getting exceptional value by choosing salvage - a quality vehicle at a fraction of the cost of a clean title equivalent.*","[PREMIUM]",23,"3750 RECYCLE RD STE B","Rancho Cordova","CA","95742","[PREMIUM]"

This wonderfully fuel-efficient vehicle offers a supple ride, quick acceleration and superior styling without sacrificing MPGs. This low mileage Kia Optima has barely been touched. It's the next best thing to buying new. Look no further, you have found exactly what you've been looking for. More information about the 2013 Kia Optima: Compared to other mid-size sedans, the Kia Optima continues to stand out for several reasons. Showcasing Kia's more Euro-influenced design direction, the Optima has styling that's more exciting than that of other mid-size sedans, especially from the outside. And that design works out to be quite roomy on the inside. It's also one of the most fuel-efficient mid-size sedans, and it offers quite sporty performance considering its mileage numbers. The turbocharged engine in the SX in particular provides the power and acceleration of a V6 but the gas mileage of a four. The Optima is also a very strong value, with a few more features at each trim level than what's found in most comparable models. Kia's strong 10-year warranty on powertrain components remains another strong selling point. Interesting features of this model are strong acceleration in the SX, fuel-efficient powertrains, interior space, features and value for the money, strong warranty coverage, and Crisp, Euro-influenced styling<br><br>","[PREMIUM]",21,"230 Automall Dr","Roseville","CA","95661","[PREMIUM]"

This Hyundai Sonata will help you keep the extra money you'd normally spend on gas. This 2013 Hyundai Sonata has such low mileage it has been parked more than driven. This vehicle won't last long, take it home today. More information about the 2013 Hyundai Sonata: Hyundai has put longtime mid-size best-sellers, including the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, directly into its sites with the Sonata. Hyundai meets or exceeds those models in most respects. With EPA fuel economy ratings of up to 24 mpg city, 35 highway, thanks to a direct-injection 4-cylinder engine, the Sonata has fuel-efficiency and power performance numbers that are both better than most base-model mid-size sedans. The Sonata Hybrid promises strong fuel efficiency. The Sonata is classified by the EPA as a large car, and has more passenger room than most of its competitors, while it has significantly more trunk space than the Toyota Camry, Nissan Altima, Ford Fusion and Chevrolet Malibu. The Sonata is also lighter than many cars in its class and has a short 35.8-foot turning diameter that's also shorter than most other mid-size sedans. The Sonata also has a trump card in safety, as it's a Top Safety Pick by the IIHS. Warranty continues to be a strong selling point for the Sonata. Like with all Hyundai products; the Sonata includes a 5-year/60,000-mile fully transferable bumper-to-bumper warranty, 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty and five years of roadside go cheassistance. Strengths of this model include Strong, fuel-efficient engine, radically different styling inside and out, excellent ride quality, high-tech communications and entertainment features, trunk space, and roomy interior<br><br>","[PREMIUM]",21,"200 Automall Dr","Roseville","CA","95661","[PREMIUM]"
